vunetpicox is deprecated. The new more general projects
[libioth](https://github.com/virtualsquare/libioth) and

the functionalities formerly provided by vunetpicox in a more general way.
Programs using `libioth` can use picoxnet as well as any other compatible
networking stack. Mudules like `ioth\_picox` can be loaded at run time as
plug-ins.
